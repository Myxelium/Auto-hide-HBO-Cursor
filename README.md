# Auto-hide-HBO-Cursor
This is a chromium extension which allows the cursor to hide when its not moved while watching HBO MAX 


I have yet to publish this to Chrome store.

Install 

1. Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
2. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
4. Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.

It's ready to go.

Hope this gets rid of the annoying mouse cursor covering the movie :)
